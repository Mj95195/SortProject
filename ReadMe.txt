This is a sorting project that demonstrates how different sorts are done. The sorts demonstrated are bubble, insertion, selection, merge, and quick sort.

There is a main.py and main.exe, both of which can be used to run the sorting application.

There is also an example video called Example.mp4 that can be downloaded and played by itself, showing the different sorts in action.
